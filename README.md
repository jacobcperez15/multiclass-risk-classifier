# Classifying risk in life insurance underwriting while addressing human needs
This repo was created to share the final project from my Master of Science in Data Science program at Lewis University. 

I decided on the topic of risk classification in the life insurance industry, since I was working in the space. At that time our team was redesigning the digital quote experience, so I took on this project to better understand how it could be improved for the shopper and for the business. 

This was an important problem to solve because there has been a steady decline in life insurance policies, and constantly misclassifying risk (or adverse selection) leads to unecessary costs. 

I'm currently revisiting this project to update it so it can be replicated using current packages, as well as to continue experimenting with models that better deal with imbalanced datasets.
