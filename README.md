# multiclass-risk-classifier
This repo was created to share my final project for my Data Science Masters Program.
I'm currently revisiting this project to update it so it can be replicated using current packages, 
as well as to continue experimenting with models that better deal with imbalanced datasets (this work is in the Google Colab file).
